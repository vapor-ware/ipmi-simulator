# IPMI Simulator

[![Build Status](https://build.vio.sh/buildStatus/icon?job=vapor-ware/ipmi-simulator/master)](https://build.vio.sh/blue/organizations/jenkins/vapor-ware%2Fipmi-simulator/activity)

`ipmi_sim` in a lightweight Docker container.

## Usage
`lan.conf` and `sim.emu` are used to configure `ipmi_sim`. They are built into the image,
so if updating any configurations, this repo must be cloned, the configs updated, and the
image rebuilt.

### Getting the Image
To get the image, you can either pull it from DockerHub

```console
$ docker pull vaporio/ipmi-simulator
```
 
 
Or, build it directly from source

```console
$ docker build -f Dockerfile -t vaporio/ipmi-simulator .
```

A Makefile target is also provided

```console
$ make build
```

### Running the Simulator
The Docker image will run `ipmi_sim` with its default command. Starting it is as easy as

```console
$ docker run -d -p 623:623/udp vaporio/ipmi-simulator
```

This can also be done via the Makefile

```console
$ make run
```

With the container running, you can test it out with [`ipmitool`](https://github.com/ipmitool/ipmitool)

```console
$ ipmitool -H 127.0.0.1 -U ADMIN -P ADMIN -I lanplus chassis status
System Power         : on
Power Overload       : true
Power Interlock      : active
Main Power Fault     : true
Power Control Fault  : true
Power Restore Policy : unknown
Last Power Event     : 
Chassis Intrusion    : inactive
Front-Panel Lockout  : inactive
Drive Fault          : false
Cooling/Fan Fault    : false
```

### ipmitool support
Note that not all `ipmitool` commands are likely to work, since this is currently just
a simple simulator with minimal configuration. The snippet below describes the commands
that are currently supported by the IPMI similator via ipmitool

```bash
# Firmware Version
ipmitool [options] mc info

# User
ipmitool [options] user summary
ipmitool [options] user list

# Chassis Commands
ipmitool [options] chassis status

# Chassis Power Commands
ipmitool [options] chassis power on
ipmitool [options] chassis power off
ipmitool [options] chassis power cycle
ipmitool [options] chassis power reset
ipmitool [options] chassis power status

# Chassis Power Commands (same as above block)
ipmitool [options] power on
ipmitool [options] power off
ipmitool [options] power cycle
ipmitool [options] power reset
ipmitool [options] power status

# Chassis Identify
ipmitool [options] identify [value]

# Get Boot Target
ipmitool [options] chassis bootparam get 5

# Set Boot Target
ipmitool [options] chassis bootdev [none|pxe|disk|cdrom|bios]
```
